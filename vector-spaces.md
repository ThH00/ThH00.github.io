A linear space (or vector space) $\{V,+;\mathbb{R},.\}$ consists of a set $V$ and two operations, an addition $(+)$ and a scalar multiplication $(.)$ with the following properties for all ${\bf u}, {\bf v}, {\bf w}\in V$, $\alpha, \beta\in\mathbb{R}$
(i) $\alpha\cdot{\bf u}+\beta\cdot{\bf v}\in V\qquad$ (closure)
