# Relationship between Small Rotation Tensors and Skew Symmetric Tensors

If ${\bf R}$ represents a small rotations around some axis by a small angle $\Delta \theta$, we can Taylor-expand it in the form

${\bf R} = {\bf I}+{\bf A}\Delta\theta+O(\Delta\theta)^2$,

for some tensor ${\bf A}$ where ${\bf I}$ is the identity and $O(\Delta\theta)^2$ denotes terms of second or higher orders in $\Delta\theta$. Since ${\bf R}$ is a rotation tensor,

${\bf R}{\bf R}^T = ({\bf I}+{\bf A}\Delta\theta+O())$
