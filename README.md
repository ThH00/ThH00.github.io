My name is Theresa Honein. I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in Summer 2024 under [Professor Oliver O'Reilly](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/oliver-m-oreilly/). I am broadly interested in the areas of dynamics and mechanics. In particular, I am currently studying the theoretical and numerical treatment of constraints in systems of rigid bodies.
