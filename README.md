    My name is Theresa Honein. I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in Summer 2024 under [Professor Oliver O'Reilly](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/oliver-m-oreilly/). I am interested utilizing tools from dynamics and mechanics to create physically accurate simulations of seemingly simple, yet actually difficult to model, phenemema. I have previously studied the treatment of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in different formulations of the equations of motion. My recent research investigated the holonomy of a rolling sphere which can be applied to the motion planning of spherical robots. I am currently interested in leveraging recent advances in numerical methods to model systems of rigid bodies experiencing frictional impact.
