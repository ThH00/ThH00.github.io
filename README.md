My name is Theresa Honein. I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in Summer 2024 under [Professor Oliver O'Reilly](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/oliver-m-oreilly). I am interested in utilizing tools from dynamics and mechanics to create physically accurate simulations of seemingly simple, yet actually difficult to model, phenomena. I have previously studied the treatment of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in different formulations of the equations of motion. I am currently interested in leveraging recent advances in numerical methods to model the nonsmooth dynamics of impacting rigid bodies.

       My name is Jamil Chahine, and I am a third-year mechanical engineering undergraduate student at AUB. I am interested in utilizing sensor data to reconstruct rigid body system dynamics and develop algorithms for practical applications. Always eager to learn, especially from scratch, and I enjoy working on systems that involve movement. Sharing what I learn, is very important to me, to contribute to a more collaborative and productive work environment. My goal is to apply mechanical engineering principles across various fields to develop useful and impactful solutions.
