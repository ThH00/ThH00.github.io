# Biography
My name is Theresa Honein. I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in Summer 2024 under [Professor Oliver O'Reilly](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/oliver-m-oreilly/). I am broadly interested utilizing tool from dynamics and mechanics to create physically accurate simulations of seemingly simple, yet actually difficult to model, phenemema. My recent research investigates the theoretical and numerical treatment of constraints in systems of rigid bodies.
