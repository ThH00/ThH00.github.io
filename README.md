My name is Theresa Honein. I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in Summer 2024 under [Professor Oliver O'Reilly](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/oliver-m-oreilly). I am interested in utilizing tools from dynamics and mechanics to create physically accurate simulations of seemingly simple, yet actually difficult to model, phenomena. I have previously studied the treatment of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints in different formulations of the equations of motion. I am currently interested in leveraging recent advances in numerical methods to model the nonsmooth dynamics of impacting rigid bodies.
