### Active Learning
Check out these two excellent videos of Professor Noel Perkins from the Univesity of Michigan at Ann Arbor explaining the active learning techniques he uses to teach dynamics! [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHEys-JHeb8), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96j69u4v-wE). We will using these techniques ourselves.

## Agenda

### Lecture 1 - Aug 26
- Dynamics: An overview.
- Review of vector geometry (dot product, cross product, magnitude, projections, Cartesian coordinates)
- Basic particle kinematics concepts (position vector, velocity, acceleration)
- Rectilinear motion (given acceleration as function of time, speed, or position)

### Lecture 2 - Aug 28
- Rectilinear motion example, MKB 2/28 from Set 1.
- Arc-length.
- Particle kinetics: BoLM and action-reaction.
- Four steps to problem solving using the balance of linear momentum (BoLM, a.k.a. Newton's second law or Euler's first law).
- [Example](notes/question_cross_product.pdf): Position, Velocity, Acceleration, and Cross Product

### Lecture 3 - Sep 2
- Cylindrical polar coordinate system.

### Lecture 4 - Sep 4
- Explaining the components of the acceleration vector.
- Gravitational force model.
- Constrained motion.

### Lecture 5 - Sep 9
- The Serret-Frenet basis.

### Lecture 6 - Sep 11
- See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ACqRREH180).
- The Serret-Frenet basis cont. (curvature of a plane curve, the S-F relations, time permitting, example Set 5, 03/043)
- Spring force with examples from Set 6.
