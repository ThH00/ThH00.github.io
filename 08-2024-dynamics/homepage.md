## Announcements

### Lecture Agendas
The detailed lecture agendas are linked [here](lectures-agenda.md).

### Link to submit HW3
Please submit HW3 via this link https://forms.office.com/r/HRajGvzegN<br>
If you are not able to complete the homework at this time, just let me know via email.

### Video lectures on Springs and Friction
I recorded a series of videos to complete the lecture from Monday Septmeber 25. I re-recorded the portion on springs with an example and explained friction.
Please watch the videos in this order.
- Explaining the spring force: https://youtu.be/WtTDHW2JUVY
- Spring Force Examples: https://youtu.be/YiOZregJx9w
- Problem 2-151: https://youtu.be/Z8Un0esREyw
- Explaining the friction force: https://youtu.be/_fvCFtpL3c8
- Particle on curve vs. surface: https://youtu.be/XNdP7Nk850s
- Problem 03-071: https://youtu.be/RDFfE0tFTnk

You may want to turn YouTube notifications on for my channel to receive notifications when the videos become available. See this link for instructions: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3382248?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid


### Midterm 1

- **Midterm 1 is postponed until further notice.**

- The midterm will cover all topics from the beginning of the class until springs (inclusive) without friction. These are equivalent to the Dynamics Primer chapters 1-3 and the springs portion of chapter 4.

-	The following formula [sheet](Midterm_1_Formulas.pdf) posted on the class website will be included with your Midterm 1 packet.

- The best way to prepare for the midterm is to review the lecture notes and to the solve the recommended problem sets.
Also, HW4 will involve a problem set style question rather than a coding-related problem in preparation for the midterm.

### Solution Videos

I have posted solution videos to a few problem set problems on my Youtube channel. (Lookup Theresa Honein on Youtube. I think that if you subscribe and click the bell icon, you will get automatic notifications when I upload a video.)

Here are direct links to the posted videos.
- [Problem 02-021](https://youtu.be/wbUBexp8xfc)
- [Problem 02-099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt5neJj4Zhc&t=911s)
- [Problem 03-004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAl3ZUiUpus&list=PLT0TfbRhIpQFwEo4f-kzETUIjA1tQqJV9&index=1)

Please solve the problems yourselves. I am more than happy to look at your problem set solutions before or after lecture and during office hours. The numerical final answers to the problems can be found at the back of the MKB textbook.

### Syllabus
Syllabus: Please read the complete [syllabus](MECH230-Syllabus-Sec2.pdf) carefully.

### Downloading Matlab
Please visit [https://matlab.mathworks.com/](https://matlab.mathworks.com/), and select sign in from the to right corner of the page, please sign in with your AUBnet account, after signing in you will find MATLAB button on the top of the page, click on MATLAB and select install MATLAB, will redirect you to another page, please click on download for windows, and save the file, after download has completed, please start the installation, will ask you to sign in again, and accept the license agreement, select the license and click next, click next on the location of the installation, please select needed modules to install and click next, pleas check add shortcut to desktop, and uncheck improve MATLAB,, click next and then click begin install.

### Units
Before completing the recommended problems, please read this [note on units](notes/Note_on_Units.pdf).

### Active Learning
Check out these two excellent videos of Professor Noel Perkins from the Univesity of Michigan at Ann Arbor explaining the active learning techniques he uses to teach dynamics! [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHEys-JHeb8), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96j69u4v-wE). We will using these techniques ourselves.
