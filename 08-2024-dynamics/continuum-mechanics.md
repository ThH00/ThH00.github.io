# Rigid Bodies

Consider a body $\mathcal{B}$ moving in 3-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$. In general, budy $\mathcal{B}$ (a.k.a. a continuum potato) is deformable. In this class, we only consider rigid bodies.

Rigid bodies are charaterized by the face that the distance between two material points on the bodies is constant.

Particles are rigid bodies whose rotational inertia can be ignored.
